# SEO & Research Hooks

## Purpose
This document defines **how SEO tools and keyword research integrate** with the PsyMetric system *without driving architecture or content design*.

It exists to:
- prevent tool-driven drift
- ensure SEO informs, not dictates, content
- clarify how research feeds planning
- keep long-term authority as the primary goal

This document is intentionally lightweight.

## Core Principle

**Structure comes first. Research follows.**

- Page types and roles are fixed before keyword research.
- SEO tools validate and refine decisions; they do not create them.
- No content exists solely because a keyword has volume.

If SEO data conflicts with system architecture, the architecture wins.

---

## What SEO Is Used For

SEO research is used to:

- Identify common phrasing for existing concepts
- Discover synonymous or ambiguous terms
- Validate demand for comparison pages
- Prioritize which Concepts or Models to document first

SEO is *not* used to invent page types or blur content roles.

---

## Acceptable SEO Inputs

When tools like SEMrush are used, acceptable inputs include:

- Keyword variations for a known Concept
- Search intent classification (definition vs procedural vs comparison)
- Related questions ("People also ask")
- SERP feature presence (featured snippets, knowledge panels)

These inputs inform wording and prioritization, not structure.

---

## Unacceptable SEO Inputs

The following must not drive content creation:

- Pure volume chasing
- Trend spikes unrelated to core Concepts
- Clickbait phrasing
- Headline optimization that changes page intent

SEO signals are advisory, not authoritative.

---

## Keyword Mapping Rules

- One primary keyword cluster per page
- Keyword clusters map to **existing page types** only
- No multiple pages targeting the same intent

If multiple keywords map to the same intent, they belong on one page.

---

## Comparison Page Triggers

SEO research may justify creating a Comparison page when:

- Two entities are frequently queried together
- Users search explicitly for "X vs Y"
- The comparison clarifies a real conceptual distinction

Comparison pages must still follow canonical anatomy rules.

---

## Content Expansion Rules

SEO research may suggest:

- Expanding an existing page with clarifying sections
- Adding examples or explanations
- Creating a new Concept page *only if the concept is distinct*

SEO must not cause:
- Splitting concepts unnaturally
- Creating near-duplicate pages

---

## Metrics & Evaluation

SEO success is evaluated by:

- Ranking stability over time
- Breadth of Concepts covered
- Citation by LLMs and external references
- Internal coherence of the knowledge graph

Short-term traffic spikes are not a success metric.

---

## Tool Independence

The system must remain functional without any SEO tools.

SEO tools are:
- optional
- temporary
- replaceable

The knowledge system is permanent.

---

## Invariants

- SEO informs prioritization, not structure
- Keywords do not create authority
- Long-term coherence outweighs short-term traffic

If SEO practices conflict with this document, this document wins unless explicitly amended.

---

## Status
This document completes the site and wiki planning set.

All core architectural and content decisions are now locked.
